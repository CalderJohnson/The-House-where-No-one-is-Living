This is where she…she…
No, this is simply where her body was found.
Still, I can’t even bring myself to go on it.
Even if you don’t have a death wish, the lack of railings and the depth of the pond definitely spell trouble for a non-swimmer like me.
When we hung out here after our classes, she always used to joke that she’d jump in and take me with her…but we both knew she valued her outfit more than her intrusive thoughts.
I guess if she ever did, she could swiftly fish me out like that one time I tried to pretend I was a pirate on the 2nd grade trip to the beach.
To this day, she never let me forget about that...well, I guess, up until last week.
With swimming skills like that, why did she drown?
Why did she die?
Why couldn’t I save her like she saved me?
The best I can do is look around for clues, but that won’t bring her back. I’m familiar with being too little, too late, but damn, does it still sting.
And after being here so long, the police are starting to look more and more right. I guess my stubbornness isn’t enough to find the truth.
I'm not enough...
