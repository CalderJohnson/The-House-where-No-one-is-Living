<i>Houses are designed for living, are they not?</i>
<i>Sights, sounds, even the scent that greets you upon opening the front door can put nostalgia into overdrive.</i>
<i>When someone in a house dies, their memories remain alive in everyone’s minds, for better or worse.</i>
<i>But when no one’s left, the house itself seems to die…every room falling into disrepair.</i>
<i>The kitchen’s appliances grow dull and rusty, never to prepare a meal again.</i>
<i>The dining room will never again be a place where conversations flow.</i>
<i>And the <b>living</b> room…well, isn’t that ironic?</i>
Anyways, who am I kidding? I’m the furthest thing from a writer, I’m an accounting major.
I guess writing in this notebook’s become my way to cope - but seriously? Filling the last gift she gave me with gibberish about an abandoned house?
Must be scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas…That’s what I get for writing about the first thing I saw.
The pond was an obviously better choice, but I still can’t bring myself to look at it for too long…
If she were here, she’d laugh and say, “Really? Musing about an abandoned house is the best you could do? With that choice of topic…your major’s definitely showing. Go outside. Touch grass. Live a little!”
What’s actually ironic is that she, the one so full of life, had hers cut so short.
“If she were here…”
How many times have I written that in the past week?
I don’t think I could ever understand. The police quickly deemed it a suicide given she drowned in this pond with no one around, but the Sylvia I know would never. Could never.
She was so vibrant and energetic, a ray of sunshine to everyone she met. Friends, grades, humor, accolades…everything came so easy for her. Admittedly, her family life wasn’t ideal, but she still had a lot to live for.
Maybe I’m in denial. People say that I don’t know my best friend as well as I thought I did. 
But, we’ve been friends since elementary school.
I know her – honestly more than I know myself.
And I still can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to this.
That’s why I’m here. To investigate.
I’d been looking around here since this morning, but so far my search for answers had been fruitless.
Speaking of which, I sat here to eat the lunch I packed, not wax poetic. I should get back to it.
Even if I find nothing, at least I’ll get some closure…
